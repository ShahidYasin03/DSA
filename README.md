I am trying to learn DSA after my exams break.
It feels like i have forgotten everything but I'll keep trying.
I don't know what to write in this Readme file so i am using it as journal to talk to myself and keep myself motivated.


(Friday, 7/5/24):  Today I am going to sleep because I don't have energy to work, there was light out the whole day.
